Objective:
Redesign the main navigation menu for Minecore Group following Stripe's navigation best practices.

General Design Instructions:
- Implement a two-level navigation system.
- When hovering over a top menu item, open a structured, two-column dropdown.
- Left Column: Group Titles (outcome categories or logical clusters).
- Right Column: Sub-items (specific services or solutions with a short micro-description under each).
- Keep the design minimal: clean white background, soft section dividers (no hard lines), subtle hover highlights.
- Use smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions when dropdowns open/close.
- Prioritize fast readability and clean hierarchy.

Mobile Instructions:
- On mobile, convert dropdowns into expandable accordion menus.
- First click = open category group.
- Second click = select sub-item.
