op 5 Likely Root Causes
1. ⚠️ The widget script (chat-widget.js) has a broken or outdated implementation
The widget you’re loading from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/WayneSimpson/n8n-chatbot-template@ba944c3/chat-widget.js has had known issues reported with not rendering anything unless mounted in a very specific DOM state.

It may expect window.ChatWidgetConfig before execution—but no fallback logic or polling exists in that script.

It also has no error logging—so if the config is missing or malformed at execution, it just silently fails.

✅ Fix:

Replace this script with your working nocode-chat-embed.js, which is self-contained and actually renders a DOM element.

Or, fork and fix Wayne’s widget, ensuring window.ChatWidgetConfig is either polled or awaited.

2. 🚫 The ChatWidgetConfig is being declared too late (or asynchronously after script execution)
Even with defer, if chat-widget.js loads before window.ChatWidgetConfig is defined, it will fail silently.

This explains why the widget loads in a blank test HTML when structured properly, but not in Vite/React—where timing and render order are unpredictable.

✅ Fix:
Wrap the loader inside your config script:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>
  window.ChatWidgetConfig = { /* ... config here ... */ };

  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/WayneSimpson/n8n-chatbot-template@ba944c3/chat-widget.js';
  script.async = true;
  document.body.appendChild(script);
</script>
This guarantees the config exists before widget loads.

3. ❌ No widget root element or DOM anchor point is injected
The script expects to inject into the body or a container that may not yet exist in the DOM at time of execution.

In a Vite/React environment, the app shell can delay hydration, causing the widget script to miss its injection window.

✅ Fix: Make sure your script runs after window.onload or inject manually with your custom script after verifying the DOM is ready.

4. 🔐 CSP (Content Security Policy) or CORs Block
If you’re hosting from a secure domain or using Netlify/Cloudflare/Hostinger with a restrictive Content Security Policy, inline scripts or external scripts from jsdelivr.net may be blocked.

Or, the N8n webhook might not respond properly due to CORS settings on your server.

✅ Fix:

Check DevTools > Console > Network and look for red errors, especially related to:

Refused to load script...

Blocked by CORS policy...

Unexpected token or undefined at line x

If needed, add this to your <meta> to temporarily relax CSP (for testing):

html
Copy
Edit
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob:;">
5. 🧱 CSS hides or misplaces the widget
The widget might be rendering, but its CSS or z-index makes it invisible or places it off screen.

If your layout container uses overflow: hidden or if a z-index: 0 overlay blocks interaction, this would do it.

✅ Fix:

In DevTools, search for DOM nodes containing chat-widget or similar.

Manually inspect if it's:

hidden (display: none)

moved off screen (bottom: -9999px)

visually covered (z-index issues)

🔧 Recommended Action Plan
✅ Use your working nocode-chat-embed.js script for full control. It bypasses third-party script timing issues.

🛠️ Or wrap Wayne’s widget in your own loader (as shown above) to ensure it loads after ChatWidgetConfig is set.

🔍 Check browser DevTools Console and Network tab for errors.

🔒 Inspect for CSP or CORS errors in Network tab.

🧪 Create a standalone HTML test file (not React/Vite) with just:

ChatWidgetConfig

your webhook

script loader
to verify that the config + webhook + loader combo works outside the app.

👀 Inspect the DOM for widget presence and potential CSS conflicts.
