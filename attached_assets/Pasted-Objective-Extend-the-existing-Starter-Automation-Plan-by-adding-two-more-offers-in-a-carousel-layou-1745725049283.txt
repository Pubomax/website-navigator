Objective:
Extend the existing Starter Automation Plan by adding two more offers in a carousel layout. The carousel should allow users to slide horizontally between the 3 plans: Starter Automation Plan, Qualified Leads Delivery Plan, and Chatbot Leads & Support Plan.

General Instructions:
- Keep all 3 plans in the same design style (font, spacing, colors).
- Use a horizontal sliding carousel (SwiperJS, GlideJS, SplideJS or any basic custom carousel logic) with simple left/right arrows or swipe gesture on mobile.
- Display 1 card at a time on mobile, and 2–3 cards at a time on desktop.
- Each plan card should have:
  - Plan Title
  - Price
  - Short Tagline
  - List of Features with ✅ icon
  - "Get Started" button at the bottom

Starter Plan (already present):
- No change unless polishing for visual consistency.
