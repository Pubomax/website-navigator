# SEO & Discoverability Assessment

## Technical SEO Analysis

### Meta Tag Implementation

The website uses a centralized approach to meta tag management through the `PageTitle` component, which ensures consistency and completeness across pages. This component:

- Sets appropriate page titles using a `pageKey` system
- Implements proper meta descriptions
- Adds meta keywords when provided
- Sets canonical URLs
- Configures language alternates
- Sets appropriate Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags

**Strengths:**
- Centralized approach prevents inconsistencies
- Dynamic title generation based on page context
- Proper internationalization with hreflang tags
- Complete social sharing meta tags

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some keywords in the examples seem to be keyword-stuffed (e.g., the Home page has many comma-separated keywords)
- Meta descriptions could be more compelling and action-oriented in some cases

### Robots.txt Configuration

The robots.txt file is well-structured with:

- Proper global permissions (`Allow: /`)
- Appropriate disallow rules for admin, API, and certain private sections
- Explicit allow rules for key marketing pages to ensure crawling
- Specific directives for major search engines (Googlebot, Bingbot, Slurp)
- Correct sitemap location reference

**Strengths:**
- Prevents crawling of unnecessary pages and admin sections
- Prioritizes important content for crawling
- Correctly references the sitemap location

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could add crawl-delay directive for non-Google bots to manage crawl rate
- Consider adding more specific crawl directives for image and mobile crawlers

### Sitemap.xml Implementation

The sitemap implementation is robust, generated dynamically through server-side code:

- Includes all important pages
- Provides appropriate change frequency and priority settings
- Includes both language versions with proper hreflang alternates
- Follows sitemap protocol standards
- Includes lastmod dates

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all site pages
- Properly structured with priorities and change frequencies
- Good handling of multi-language alternatives
- Server-side generation ensures freshness

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Consider implementing separate sitemaps for different content types (pages, blog posts, case studies)
- Image sitemap could be beneficial for visual content

### Canonicalization

The site implements proper canonicalization through:

- Canonical link tags in the page head
- Consistent URL structures
- Language alternates with proper hreflang attributes

**Strengths:**

- Properly handles multi-language content
- Consistent implementation across pages

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Ensure consistent trailing slash usage (or non-usage) across all URLs

**Strengths:**

- Implementation follows Schema.org standards

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The LocalBusiness schema contains placeholder data in some fields (address shows "Your Street Address")

- Some schema implementations could be more specific (e.g., using ServiceType more precisely)

### Rich Snippet Eligibility

- Local business knowledge panel
- Breadcrumb rich results
- FAQ rich results (for FAQ pages)
- Service/product rich results

**Strengths:**
- Multiple rich snippet opportunities
- Good breadcrumb implementation
- FAQ schema for FAQ pages

**Areas for Improvement:**
