Objective:
Correct the Industries dropdown navigation to group links properly with unified title + description formatting, based on user outcome and visitor expectation.

Requirements:

1. One Left Column (Sector Categories):
- "Private Sector"
- "Public Sector"
- "Business Size"

(Left items are section labels only — no links.)

2. One Right Column (Sector Pages):

- When hovering "Private Sector" (left):
  - Show these links in right column:
    - Manufacturing (Clickable title link) ➔ Small description below: "Automation solutions for production and operations."
    - Finance (Clickable title link) ➔ Small description below: "Smart solutions for financial services and banking."
    - Retail (Clickable title link) ➔ Small description below: "Automate customer engagement and inventory management."
    - Healthcare (Clickable title link) ➔ Small description below: "Compliant automation solutions for healthcare providers."

- When hovering "Public Sector" (left):
  - Show:
    - Public Sector (Clickable title link) ➔ Small description: "Efficient solutions for government organizations."

- When hovering "Business Size" (left):
  - Show:
    - Micro Enterprises (Clickable title link) ➔ "Affordable solutions for businesses with 1-10 employees."
    - Mid-Sized Enterprises (Clickable title link) ➔ "Scalable automation for businesses with 10-250 employees."
    - Large Enterprises (Clickable title link) ➔ "Enterprise-grade solutions for 250+ employee organizations."

Technical Rules:
- Each link (Manufacturing, Finance, etc.) must be a clickable `<a>` HTML element.
- The description must appear directly underneath the clickable title, in a smaller, muted gray font.
- There must be no break between title and description — they form a single block.
- No second independent columns; one clean right column only.
- Switch content dynamically based on hover over left categories.
- Smooth fade transition when switching panels (optional but preferred, 200ms fade-in).
- Keep layout clean, minimal, premium style like Stripe.com.

Accessibility Rules:
- Maintain keyboard navigation (tab between links).
- Use ARIA roles if necessary for the nav.

Styling Requirements:
- Title font: 16px, dark color (#111827).
- Description font: 14px, muted gray color (#6b7280).
- Space between title and description: 4-6px.
- Space between items: 16px vertically.
- No bullets, no borders.

Deliverable:
- Clean HTML, CSS, and minimal JS.
- Modular code for reuse.
- Fully responsive.

Important: 
Do not split items into multiple unrelated columns.  
One sector group at a time dynamically displayed.  
Title and description must stay visually and structurally connected.
