   - Verify that each page clearly communicates the company’s offerings and value propositions, including detailed service descriptions, case studies, and client testimonials.

   - Ensure the content is tailored for different business sizes (micro, mid, large enterprises) and sectors (manufacturing, finance, retail, healthcare, public sector).

2. **Technology & Development:**
   - Evaluate if the website is built using modern, scalable technologies. Confirm it is fully responsive, mobile-friendly, and optimized for fast load times.
   - Check for SEO best practices (structured data, proper meta tags, alt text on images, optimized code, and secure HTTPS).
   - Review the integration of interactive elements (dynamic filtering for services, case studies, etc.) and ensure the website’s backend (CMS, analytics, lead capture) is robust.

3. **User Experience (UX):**
   - Assess the website’s navigation structure and overall layout: is the information architecture intuitive and easy to navigate?
   - Evaluate the use of visuals, interactive elements, and design consistency across pages.

   - Verify that the website’s visual identity (colors, typography, logo) and tone of voice reflect Minecore Group’s brand guidelines.
   - Ensure that the website communicates the company’s mission (“Empowering Digital Transformation”) and vision effectively throughout the content.
